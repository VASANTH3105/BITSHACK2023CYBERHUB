                        <p>Welcome to Network Security Concepts!
                            <br><br> Perhaps you’ve heard one of the hundreds of news stories about a data security breach within a large corporation or even a government. Was your credit card number exposed by a breach? Your private health information?
                            Would you like to know how to prevent these data breaches? The field of network security is growing every day. This module provides a detailed landscape of the types of cybercrime and the many ways we have to fight back against
                            cybercriminals. Let’s get started!<br><br></p>

                    <p>Hacking started in the 1960s with phone freaking, or phreaking, which refers to using audio frequencies to manipulate phone systems. At that time, telephone switches used various tones to indicate different functions. Early hackers
                        realized that by mimicking a tone using a whistle, they could exploit the phone switches to make free long-distance calls.<br><br>In the mid-1980s, computer dial-up modems were used to connect computers to networks. Hackers wrote
                        “war dialing” programs which dialed each telephone number in a given area in search of computers. When a computer was found, password-cracking programs were used to gain access.</p>

                    <h3>5.4 Address Spoofing Attacks</h3>
                    <p>IP address spoofing attacks occur when a threat actor creates packets with false source IP address information to either hide the identity of the sender, or to pose as another legitimate user. The threat actor can then gain access
                        to otherwise inaccessible data or circumvent security configurations. Spoofing is usually incorporated into another attack such as a Smurf attack.<br><br> Spoofing attacks can be non-blind or blind:<br><br>

                        <strong>. Non-blind spoofing </strong>- The threat actor can see the traffic that is being sent between the host and the target. The threat actor uses non-blind spoofing to inspect the reply packet from the target victim. Non-blind
                        spoofing determines the state of a firewall and sequence-number prediction. It can also hijack an authorized session.<br><br>
                        <strong>. Blind spoofing </strong>- The threat actor cannot see the traffic that is being sent between the host and the target. Blind spoofing is used in DoS attacks.<br><br> MAC address spoofing attacks are used when threat actors
                        have access to the internal network. Threat actors alter the MAC address of their host to match another known MAC address of a target host, as shown in the figure. The attacking host then sends a frame throughout the network with
                        the newly-configured MAC address. When the switch receives the frame, it examines the source MAC address.</p>

                        <li>
                            <bold>Reliable delivery</bold> - TCP incorporates acknowledgments to guarantee delivery, instead of relying on upper-layer protocols to detect and resolve errors. If a timely acknowledgment is not received, the sender retransmits
                            the data. Requiring acknowledgments of received data can cause substantial delays. Examples of application layer protocols that make use of TCP reliability include HTTP, SSL/TLS, FTP, DNS zone transfers, and others.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flow control </strong>- TCP implements flow control to address this issue. Rather than acknowledge one segment at a time, multiple segments can be acknowledged with a single acknowledgment segment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stateful communication</strong> - TCP stateful communication between two parties occurs during the TCP three-way handshake. Before data can be transferred using TCP, a three-way handshake opens the TCP connection, as shown
                            in the figure. If both sides agree to the TCP connection, data can be sent and received by both parties using TCP.</li>

                        <br><br>The TCP SYN Flood attack exploits the TCP three-way handshake. The figure shows a threat actor continually sending TCP SYN session request packets with a randomly spoofed source IP address to a target. The target device
                        replies with a TCP SYN-ACK packet to the spoofed IP address and waits for a TCP ACK packet. Those responses never arrive. Eventually the target host is overwhelmed with half-open TCP connections, and TCP services are denied to
                        legitimate users. TCP Reset Attack<br><br>A TCP reset attack can be used to terminate TCP communications between two hosts. TCP can terminate a connection in a civilized (i.e., normal) manner and uncivilized (i.e., abrupt) manner.<br><br>The
                        figure displays the civilized manner when TCP uses a four-way exchange consisting of a pair of FIN and ACK segments from each TCP endpoint to close the TCP connection.<br><br>The uncivilized manner is when a host receives an TCP
                        segment with the RST bit set. This is an abrupt way to tear down the TCP connection and inform the receiving host to immediately stop using the TCP connection.<br><br>A threat actor could do a TCP reset attack and send a spoofed

                        <br><br> TCP session hijacking is another TCP vulnerability. Although difficult to conduct, a threat actor takes over an already-authenticated host as it communicates with the target. The threat actor must spoof the IP address
                        of one host, predict the next sequence number, and send an ACK to the other host. If successful, the threat actor could send, but not receive, data from the target device.<br><br></p>

                    <h3>6.4 UDP Segment Header and Operation</h3>
                    <p>UDP is commonly used by DNS, TFTP, NFS, and SNMP. It is also used with real-time applications such as media streaming or VoIP. UDP is a connectionless transport layer protocol. It has much lower overhead than TCP because it is not
                        connection-oriented and does not offer the sophisticated retransmission, sequencing, and flow control mechanisms that provide reliability. The UDP segment structure, shown in the figure, is much smaller than TCP’s segment structure.<br><br>Although
                        UPD is normally called unreliable, in contrast to TCP’s reliability, this does not mean that applications that use UDP are always unreliable, nor does it mean that UDP is an inferior protocol. It means that these functions are
                        not provided by the transport layer protocol and must be implemented elsewhere if required.
                        <br><br> The low overhead of UDP makes it very desirable for protocols that make simple request and reply transactions. For example, using TCP for DHCP would introduce unnecessary network traffic. If no response is received, the
                        device resends the request.</p>

                    <h3>6.5 UDP Attacks</h3>
                    <p>UDP is not protected by any encryption. You can add encryption to UDP, but it is not available by default. The lack of encryption means that anyone can see the traffic, change it, and send it on to its destination. Changing the data
                        in the traffic will alter the 16-bit checksum, but the checksum is optional and is not always used. When the checksum is used, the threat actor can create a new checksum based on the new data payload, and then record it in the
                        header as a new checksum. The destination device will find that the checksum matches the data without knowing that the data has been altered. This type of attack is not widely used.<br><br><strong>UDP Flood Attacks</strong><br><br>You
                        are more likely to see a UDP flood attack. In a UDP flood attack, all the resources on a network are consumed. The threat actor must use a tool like UDP Unicorn or Low Orbit Ion Cannon. These tools send a flood of UDP packets,
                        often from a spoofed host, to a server on the subnet. The program will sweep through all the known ports trying to find closed ports. This will cause the server to reply with an ICMP port unreachable message. Because there are
                        many closed ports on the server, this creates a lot of traffic on the segment, which uses up most of the bandwidth. The result is very similar to a DoS attack.<br></p>

                    <h3>7.1 ARP Vulnerabilities</h3>
                    <p>Earlier in this module you learned about vulnerabilities with IP, TCP and UDP. The TCP/IP protocol suite was never built for security. Therefore, the services that IP uses for addressing functions such as ARP, DNS, and DHCP, are also
                        not secure, as you will learn in this topic.
                        <br><br> Hosts broadcast an ARP Request to other hosts on the segment to determine the MAC address of a host with a particular IP address. All hosts on the subnet receive and process the ARP Request. The host with the matching
                        IP address in the ARP Request sends an ARP Reply.<br><br>Any client can send an unsolicited ARP Reply called a “gratuitous ARP.” This is often done when a device first boots up to inform all other devices on the local network of
                        the new device’s MAC address. When a host sends a gratuitous ARP, other hosts on the subnet store the MAC address and IP address contained in the gratuitous ARP in their ARP tables.<br><br> This feature of ARP also means that any
                        host can claim to be the owner of any IP or MAC. A threat actor can poison the ARP cache of devices on the local network, creating an MITM attack to redirect traffic. The goal is to target a victim host, and have it change its
                        default gateway to the threat actor’s device. This positions the threat actor in between the victim and all other systems outside of the local subnet.<br></p>

                    <p>To stop DNS tunneling, the network administrator must use a filter that inspects DNS traffic. Pay close attention to DNS queries that are longer than average, or those that have a suspicious domain name. DNS solutions, like Cisco OpenDNS,
                        block much of the DNS tunneling traffic by identifying suspicious domains.</p>

                    <h3>8.1 Securing Communications</h3>
                    <p>Organizations must provide support to secure the data as it travels across links. This may include internal traffic, but it is even more important to protect the data that travels outside of the organization to branch sites, telecommuter
                        sites, and partner sites.<br><br></p>
                    <h7>These are the four elements of secure communications:</h7>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Integrity -</strong>Guarantees that the message was not altered. Any changes to data in transit will be detected. Integrity is ensured by implementing either of the Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA-2 or SHA-3). The MD5
                            message digest algorithm is still widely in use but it is inherently insecure and creates vulnerabilities in a network. The use of MD5 should be avoided.</li>
                        <li><strong>Origin Authentication -</strong>Guarantees that the message is not a forgery and does actually come from whom it states. Many modern networks ensure authentication with protocols, such as hash message authentication code
                            (HMAC).
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Data Confidentiality -</strong>Guarantees that only authorized users can read the message. If the message is intercepted, it cannot be deciphered within a reasonable amount of time. Data confidentiality is implemented using
                            symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Non-Repudiation  -</strong>Guarantees that the sender cannot repudiate, or refute, the validity of a message sent. Nonrepudiation relies on the fact that only the sender has the unique characteristics or signature
                            for how that message is treated.</li>

                    <h3>8.2 Hash Functions</h3>
                    <p>There are four well-known hash functions.
                        <br><br>
                        <storng>
                            MD5 with 128-bit Digest
                        </storng><br><br> Developed by Ron Rivest and used in a variety of internet applications, MD5 is a one-way function that produces a 128-bit hashed message. MD5 is considered to be a legacy algorithm and should be avoided and used
                        only when no better alternatives are available. It is recommended that SHA-2 or SHA-3 be used instead.<br><br>
                        <strong>SHA Hashing Algorithm</strong><br><br>Developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) in 1995. It is very similar to the MD5 hash functions. Several versions exist. SHA-1 creates a 160-bit hashed message and is slightly
                        slower than MD5. SHA-1 has known flaws and is a legacy algorithm.<br><br><strong>SHA-2</strong><br><br> Developed by the NSA. It includes SHA-224 (224 bit), SHA-256 (256 bit), SHA-384 (384 bit), and SHA-512 (512 bit). If you are
                        using SHA-2, then the SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 algorithms should be used whenever possible.<br><br><strong>SHA-3</strong><br><br>SHA-3 is the newest hashing algorithm and was introduced by NIST as an alternative and eventual
                        replacement for the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms. SHA-3 includes SHA3-224 (224 bit), SHA3-256 (256 bit), SHA3-384 (384 bit), and SHA3-512 (512 bit). The SHA-3 family are next-generation algorithms and should be used whenever
                        possible. While hashing can be used to detect accidental changes, it cannot be used to guard against deliberate changes that are made by a threat actor. There is no unique identifying information from the sender in the hashing
                        procedure. This means that anyone can compute a hash for any data, as long as they have the correct hash function. For example, when the message traverses the network, a potential attacker could intercept the message, change it,
                        recalculate the hash, and append it to the message. The receiving device will only validate against whatever hash is appended. Therefore, hashing is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and does not provide security to transmitted
                        data. To provide integrity and origin authentication, something more is required.<br><br>

                    <h3>8.3 Origin Authentication</h3>
                    <p>To add authentication to integrity assurance, use a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC uses an additional secret key as input to the hash function.<br><br>Only the sender and the receiver know the secret key, and the
                        output of the hash function now depends on the input data and the secret key. Only parties who have access to that secret key can compute the digest of an HMAC function. This defeats man-in-the-middle attacks and provides authentication
                        of the data origin.
                        <br><br> If two parties share a secret key and use HMAC functions for authentication, a properly constructed HMAC digest of a message that a party has received indicates that the other party was the originator of the message. This
                        is because the other party possesses the secret key.</p>

                    <h3>8.4 Data Confidentiality</h3>
                    <p>There are two classes of encryption used to provide data confidentiality. These two classes differ in how they use keys.<br><br> Symmetric encryption algorithms such as Data Encryption Standard (DES), 3DES, and Advanced Encryption
                        Standard (AES) are based on the premise that each communicating party knows the pre-shared key. Data confidentiality can also be ensured using asymmetric algorithms, including Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) and the public key
                        infrastructure (PKI). <br><br> <strong> Note:</strong> DES is a legacy algorithm and should not be used. 3DES should be avoided if possible. The figure highlights some differences between each encryption algorithm method.</p>

                    <h3>8.5 Diffie-Hellman</h3>
                    <p>Diffie-Hellman (DH) is an asymmetric mathematical algorithm where two computers generate an identical shared secret key without having communicated before. The new shared key is never actually exchanged between the sender and receiver.
                        However, because both parties know it, the key can be used by an encryption algorithm to encrypt traffic between the two systems.</p><br><br>
