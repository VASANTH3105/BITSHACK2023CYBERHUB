The trap could be in the form of a malicious attachment with an enticing name.">Baiting</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" data-description="Piggybacking is a social engineering attack in which an attacker uses another person's legitimate access to a physical or electronic location to gain unauthorized access themselves. This type of attack is often seen in office buildings, where an attacker will follow someone with an access badge into a secured area.">Piggybacking/Tailgating</li>
        <li class="list-group-item" data-description="Honeytraps are a type of romance scam in which scammers create fake online dating and social media profiles using attractive stolen photos. For example, in a military romance scam, the fraudster will pose as an active service member stationed far away and unable to meet in person.
          Once they identify a target, they‚Äôll start sending flirty and provocative messages, and quickly tell their victims they‚Äôre in love with them. But, they need the victims to prove they feel the same way by sending gifts, cash, or cryptocurrency. 
         Honeytraps are especially rampant on social media sites like //'Snapchat'\\. Make sure you're always staying safe and are aware of the dangers of online dating.">Honey traps</li>
         <li class="list-group-item" data-description="A watering hole attack occurs when hackers infect a site that they know you regularly visit. 
         When you visit the site, you automatically download malware (known as a drive-by-download). Or, you'll be taken to a fake version of the site that is designed to steal your credentials. 
         For example, scammers could divert you away from a normal login page to one designed to steal your account name and password. It will look exactly the same. But anything you enter will go straight to the scammer. 
         This is where having a password manager becomes so important. Even if a phishing site looks exactly like the real one, a password manager won‚Äôt automatically enter your credentials.">Watering Hole Attack</li>

            An attacker identifies a coffee shop with an open Wi-Fi network.
            Customers at the coffee shop are required to enter a password to connect to the network.
            The attacker waits nearby and watches as a customer enters the password to access the Wi-Fi.
            Once the customer is connected, the attacker immediately connects to the same network using the stolen password, effectively piggybacking on the legitimate user's access.
            The attacker can then attempt to launch cyber attacks or intercept sensitive data on the network.
